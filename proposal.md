    - User should see a message that they’ve successfully logged out

  - Basic security rules implemented
    - Authentication:
      - Function to check if user is logged in
      - Function should be called on appropriate pages that only allow logged in users
    - Roles/Authorization:
      - Have a roles table (see below)
 - Basic Roles implemented
  - Have a Roles table	(id, name, description, is_active, modified, created)
  - Have a User Roles table (id, user_id, role_id, is_active, created, modified)
  - Include a function to check if a user has a specific role (we won’t use it for this milestone but it should be usable in the future)
- Site should have basic styles/theme applied; everything should be styled
  - I.e., forms/input, navigation bar, etc
- Any output messages/errors should be “user friendly”
  - Any technical errors or debug output displayed will result in a loss of points
- User will be able to see their profile
  - Email, username, etc
- User will be able to edit their profile
  - Changing username/email should properly check to see if it’s available before allowing the change
  - Any other fields should be properly validated
  - Allow password reset (only if the existing correct password is provided)
    - Hint: logic for the password check would be similar to login



**Milestone 2**
 - Create the Accounts table (id, account_number [unique, always 12 characters], user_id, balance (default 0), account_type, created, modified)
 - Project setup steps:
    - Create these as initial setup scripts in the sql folder
      - Create a system user if they don’t exist (this will never be logged into, it’s just to keep things working per system requirements)
      - Create a world account in the Accounts table created below (if it doesn’t exist)
        - Account_number must be “000000000000”

      - Option 1: Generate a random 12 digit/character value; must regenerate if a duplicate collision occurs

    - Will require a minimum deposit of $5 (from the world account)
      - Entry will be recorded in the Transaction table as a transaction pair (per notes below)
      - Account Balance will be updated based on SUM of BalanceChange of AccountSrc

     - User will see user-friendly success message when account is created successfully
      - Redirect user to their Accounts page

 - User will be able to list their accounts
  - Limit results to 5 for now
  - Show account number, account type and balance
 - User will be able to click an account for more information (a.ka. Transaction History page)
  - Show account number, account type, balance, opened/created date
  - Show transaction history (from Transactions table)
     - For now limit results to 10 latest
- User will be able to deposit/withdraw from their account(s)
  - Form should have a dropdown of their accounts to pick from 
    - World account should not be in the dropdown
  - Form should have a field to enter a positive numeric value
    - For now, allow any deposit value (0 - inf)
  - For withdraw, add a check to make sure they can’t withdraw more money than the account has
  - Form should allow the user to record a memo for the transaction
  - Each transaction is recorded as a transaction pair in the Transaction table per the details below
    - These will reflect on the transaction history page (Account page’s “more info”)
    - After each transaction pair, make sure to update the Account Balance by SUMing the BalanceChange for the AccountSrc
      - This will be done after the insert
    - Deposits will be from the “world account”
      - Must fetch the world account to get the id (do not hard code the id as it may change if the application migrates or gets rebuilt)
     - Withdraws will be to the “world account”
        - Must fetch the world account to get the id (do not hard code the id as it may change if the application migrates or gets rebuilt)
     - Transaction type should show accordingly (deposit/withdraw)
  - Show appropriate user-friendly error messages
  - Show user-friendly success messages


 




**Milestone 3**

    - Form should include a dropdown of the current user’s accounts (as AccountSrc)
    - Form should include a field for the destination user’s last name
    - Form should include a field for the last 4 digits of the destination user’s account number (to lookup AccountDest)
    - Form should include a field for a positive numerical value
    - Form should allow the user to record a memo for the transaction
    - System shouldn’t let the user transfer more than the balance of their account



 
 

- Milestone 4
### Intructions
#### Don't delete this
1. Pick one project type
2. Create a proposal.md file in the root of your project directory of your GitHub repository
3. Copy the contents of the Google Doc into this readme file
4. Convert the list items to markdown checkboxes (apply any other markdown for organizational purposes)
5. Create a new Project Board on GitHub
   - Choose the Automated Kanban Board Template
   - For each major line item (or sub line item if applicable) create a GitHub issue
   - The title should be the line item text
   - The first comment should be the acceptance criteria (i.e., what you need to accomplish for it to be "complete")
   - Leave these in "to do" status until you start working on them
   - Assign each issue to your Project Board (the right-side panel)
   - Assign each issue to yourself (the right-side panel)
6. As you work
  1. As you work on features, create separate branches for the code in the style of Feature-ShortDescription (using the Milestone branch as the source)
  2. Add, commit, push the related file changes to this branch
  3. Add evidence to the PR (Feat to Milestone) conversation view comments showing the feature being implemented
     - Screenshot(s) of the site view (make sure they clearly show the feature)
     - Screenshot of the database data if applicable
     - Describe each screenshot to specify exactly what's being shown
     - A code snippet screenshot or reference via GitHub markdown may be used as an alternative for evidence that can't be captured on the screen
  4. Update the checklist of the proposal.md file for each feature this is completing (ideally should be 1 branch/pull request per feature, but some cases may have multiple)
    - Basically add an x to the checkbox markdown along with a date after
      - (i.e.,   - [x] (mm/dd/yy) ....) See Template above
    - Add the pull request link as a new indented line for each line item being completed
    - Attach any related issue items on the right-side panel
  5. Merge the Feature Branch into your Milestone branch (this should close the pull request and the attached issues)
    - Merge the Milestone branch into dev, then dev into prod as needed
    - Last two steps are mostly for getting it to prod for delivery of the assignment 
  7. If the attached issues don't close wait until the next step
  8. Merge the updated dev branch into your production branch via a pull request
  9. Close any related issues that didn't auto close
    - You can edit the dropdown on the issue or drag/drop it to the proper column on the project board
